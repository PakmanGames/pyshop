# Beginner Project in Django Tutorial

This is the final project in this video [Python Tutorial - Python Full Course For Beginners](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?si=K-c7uCYyRYGHCZHP).  
I made it following along with the tutorial and used the django framework to create a basic python web app to display grocery products.  
It also uses boostrap for certain components like the cards and simple nav bar.
